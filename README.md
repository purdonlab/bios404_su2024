By the end of the lab, students should have:
- implemented a periodogram, tapered periodogram and multitaper spectrum computation, built from basic scipy functions
- applied them in three different examples
  - white noise
  - AR(2) process
  - AR(4) process
- realized how to control Bias and Variance in spectrum estimates
- computed multitaper spectrum from segments of a real EEG data under general anesthesia
- created a spectrogram representation of a real EEG data under general anesthesia.
